My sociology honors thesis explores how belief in the importance of education interacts with belief in the importance of hard work for getting ahead among immigrants vs. native-born Americans.

<b>Abstract: </b>Belief in meritocracy persists among the U.S. public despite the reality of declining mobility. Previous research has examined the role of exposure to inequality and higher education institutions in shaping meritocratic beliefs. But immigrants are often perceived as homogenous, unquestioning believers of the “American Dream” that hard work and education determines success, and there is little clarity on whether and how immigrants’ beliefs in meritocracy differ from their native-born peers. Through analyzing the 2021 General Social Survey with Generalized Linear Models (GLM), I show that immigrants are significantly less likely than native-born Americans to regard hard work as essential for getting ahead, even when controlling for age, self-identified class, gender, and education. In addition, valuing education for getting ahead had a much smaller positive effect on immigrants’ belief in hard work than on native-born Americans when controlling for belief about wealth. These results together indicate that compared to native-born Americans who saw hard work as the essential pathway to education attainment and success, immigrants with the same belief about education are less likely to see hard work as the most important pathway to success and place a heavier emphasis on non-meritocratic determinants of education attainment. The findings highlight the importance of examining social mobility as a multi-generational and communal process, and they reflect a need for policies designed to improve access to education and employment through bolstering co-ethnic social networks.
