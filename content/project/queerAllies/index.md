My capstone project for Sex and Society seminar uses qualitative coding of 142 Twitter posts to examine themes and strategies used by adult allies to advocate for queer youth on social media.

<b>Abstract: </b>This study examines how adult discuss children’s sexuality on social media. We focus on how adult allies of queer youth to rebut the far-right discourse that queerness threatens the youth and children need to be protected from queerness. We conducted a qualitative comparative analysis of 142 tweets posted between Apr. 2022 and Apr. 2023 by adults supporting queer youth. Results suggest that adult allies express support mainly through articulating the threats to queer youth from anti-queer communities, and they draw more heavily on statistics and scientific research than personal experiences to support their arguments. Thus, adult allies more often discuss queer youth as an abstract concept that needs defending, while fewer pay attention to the experiences of individual queer children. This work goes beyond the Foucauldian conception of family and state as unanimous disciplining structures to suggest that family could be a site of resistance against the state’s discipline. Further, while previous research on queer social movements mainly focuses on the agency of queer individuals, this study highlights that the discourse of out-group members in an authoritative status, such as a parent, shapes queer identities and structures their movement. The findings call for greater attention to the role of family in sex education and in social support for non-traditional sexualities.
