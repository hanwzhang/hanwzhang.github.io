In Spring 2021, I took a writing-intensive seminar [Social Class and Environment](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FWRPR0210) at Middlebury College which culminated with a collaborative writing project on environmental justice. Check out [my op-ed](http://writingexperience.middcreate.net/social-class-and-the-environment/hanwen-zhang) about food delivery workers trapped by algorithms and [the full interactive textbook](http://writingexperience.middcreate.net/social-class-and-the-environment/index) here. 

In the op-ed, I argue for directing attention to the irrationalities produced by rational systems â€“ hunger for time instead of food, data infringing instead of expanding freedom, and super-circulation of capital rather than delivery based on need. By embedding a series of books, news articles, and podcasts into the page, I provide readers with a multi-medium understanding of the issue at hand.
