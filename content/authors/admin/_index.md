Originally from Shanghai, China, I am a recent graduate from Middlebury College with double majors in Sociology and Psychology. I am enthusiastic about data-driven work in the policy world and enjoy applying my data science knowledge to answer research questions about education and immigration, as well as solve real-world challenges in understanding social beliefs and public opinion.

Recently, I just completed my [undergraduate honors thesis in sociology](/project/factamthesis) about belief in meritocracy among immigrants in the U.S. I analyzed data from the 2021 General Social Survey to explain how belief in the importance of education and hard work for getting ahead differs between immigrants and native-borns. I presented my findings at the 2024 [Eastern Sociological Society Annual Conference](https://www.essnet.org/) in Washington, D.C. You can also check out this [interactive data visualization](https://hanwenz.shinyapps.io/Fact_Checking_the_American_Dream/) I made to help with my exploration.
