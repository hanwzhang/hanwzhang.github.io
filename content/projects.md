Here is a collection of research and writing projects I have conducted in the past. Thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of my undergraduate education, I was able to work independently or with the guidance of my mentors on a wide range of topics, including migrations research, public discourse analysis, and environmental and social policy.

This project stemmed from my winter 2023 internship at NYC Mayor's Office of Research and Communication. I was responsible for monitoring news coverage of Mayor Eric Adams and sending formatted clippings of articles to City Hall employees. I created a program that uses browser automation to scrape an article, identifies and excludes non-content text according to a customizable rules sheet. Access [the project and code](https://github.com/hanwzhang/clipmaster) on GitHub.
